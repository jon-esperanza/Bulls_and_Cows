# Bulls_and_Cows
Bulls and Cows program written in Java. I was able to implement nested classes and manipulate objects more in this project. <br>
This program creates a secret code from given input, and then allows the user to guess what the code is. <br>
If the user got one of the symbols of the code right == 1 cow; <br>
If the user got one of the symbols of the code right in the right order/position == 1 bull <br>
The user must use the clues and hints to figure out the secret code. <br>
<br> This program takes two initial inputs, then continues to ask the user for input until they guess the secret code right.
